**TkinterWeb** is a Python library that adds HTML and CSS rendering capabilities to Tkinter widgets.

Common use cases include displaying HTML content, rendering images (including SVG), building rich-text editors, designing apps with HTML templates, and creating more modern-looking interfaces, with advanced styling and even round buttons!

Getting started
---------------

TkinterWeb provides a `frame widget <./api/htmlframe.html>`_, a `label widget <./api/htmlframe.html#tkinterweb.HtmlLabel>`_, and a `text widget <./api/htmlframe.html#tkinterweb.HtmlText>`_. 

Check out the :doc:`usage` section to learn how to get started and discover tips and tricks, :doc:`faq` for frequently asked questions, and the :doc:`api` to explore all of the widgets and functions at your disposal!
