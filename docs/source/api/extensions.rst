TkinterWeb Extensions
=====================

The following objects are extensions to the :class:`~tkinterweb.TkinterWeb` widget and are largely internal. You will likely never need to access them, but they are described here just in case.

The methods described in this page may change at any time without warning. If you are relying on anything here, please let me know so I know to keep compatibility.
