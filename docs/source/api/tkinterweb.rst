The :class:`~tkinterweb.TkinterWeb` class also includes dozens of variables that can be used to change the widget's behaviour or to get the its state (eg. access embedded input widgets or the nodes under the mouse). If this widget is being used through the :class:`~tkinterweb.HtmlFrame` or :class:`~tkinterweb.HtmlLabel` widget, many of these variables are exposed as properties or as configuration options, but many more are unique and could be useful in certain cases. 

Please see the source code for more details.
