## *`TkinterWeb.TkinterWeb` Documentation*

## Overview
**The `TkinterWeb` class is the low-level widget that bridges the gap between the underlying Tcl Tkhtml3 widget and Tkinter. It provides the basic functionality nessessary for accessing Tkhtml3 from Python scripts.**

## Usage
**Because the main purpose of the TkinterWeb widget is simply to call Tkhtml3 functions, using this widget is not particularily straightfoward and is missing a lot of functionality.**
**Do not use this widget unless absolutely nessessary. Instead use the [HtmlFrame widget](HTMLFRAME.md).**

## Class API
*Please refer to the [source code](../bindings.py) of this class.*
