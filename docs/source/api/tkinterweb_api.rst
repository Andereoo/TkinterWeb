Bindings Documentation
======================

.. note::
   This API has changed significantly recently. See :doc:`the changelog <../upgrading>` for details.


The following objects offer the core bindings to the Tkhtml3 HTML widget and are largely internal. You will likely never need to access them, but they are described here just in case. 

Refer to the `Tkhtml Documentation <https://web.archive.org/web/20250219233338/http://tkhtml.tcl.tk/>`_ for more details on some of the commands.
