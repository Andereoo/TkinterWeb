# TkinterWeb 
**Fast and lightweight web browser and app design widgets for Tkinter.**

## Overview
**TkinterWeb offers bindings and extensions to a modified version of the Tkhtml3 widget from http://tkhtml.tcl.tk, which enables enables the display of HTML and CSS code in Tkinter applications.** 

Some of TkinterWeb's uses include:
* Displaying websites, feeds, help files, and other styled HTML
* Displaying images, including SVG images
* Designing apps using HTML templates
* Creating prettier apps, with rounded buttons and more!

All [major operating systems](https://tkinterweb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/compatibility.html#a-note-on-tkhtml-binaries) running Python 3.2+ are supported. 

## Usage

**TkinterWeb provides:**
* A [frame](https://tkinterweb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/htmlframe.html) widget to display websites, help files, RSS feeds, and any other styled HTML in Tkinter.
* A [label](https://tkinterweb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/htmlframe.html#tkinterweb.HtmlLabel) widget that can display styled HTML.
* A [geometry manager](https://tkinterweb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/geometry.html) to display Tkinter widgets *and HTML elements* together in a Tkinter application.

**TkinterWeb can be used in any Tkinter application to display websites, help pages, documentation, and much more! Here is an example:**
```
import tkinter as tk
from tkinterweb import HtmlFrame # import the HtmlFrame widget

root = tk.Tk() # create the Tkinter window
frame = HtmlFrame(root) # create the HtmlFrame widget
frame.load_website("http://tkhtml.tcl.tk/tkhtml.html") # load a website
frame.pack(fill="both", expand=True) # attach the HtmlFrame widget to the window
root.mainloop()
```

See [Getting Started](https://tkinterweb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html) for more tips and tricks.

## Installation
To install TkinterWeb, simply type `pip install tkinterweb` in the command prompt or terminal. That's it!

Or, you can also choose to install optional dependencies: 
* Use `pip install tkinterweb[javascript]` to also install JavaScript dependencies.
* Use `pip install tkinterweb[svg]` to also install Scalable Vector Graphics dependencies. Keep in mind these packages may not work on Windows out of the box.
* Use `pip install tkinterweb[full]` to install all optional dependencies.

## Dependencies
**In order to load webpages and show images, TkinterWeb requires the following packages:**
* Tkinter (which is automatically packaged with most Python installations)
* TkinterWeb-Tkhtml (can be installed via `pip install tkinterweb-tkhtml`)
* PIL (can be installed via `pip install pillow`)
* PIL.ImageTk (may be automatically installed with PIL on some systems, otherwise needs to be installed to load most image types)

Pip will automatically install PIL and TkinterWeb-Tkhtml when installing TkinterWeb.

## API Documentation

> [!WARNING]

## FAQs
See [Frequently Asked Questions](https://tkinterweb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html).

## Webpage Compatability
**HTML/CSS:**
* TkinterWeb supports HTML 4.01 and CSS 2.1. A full list of supported CSS declarations can be found at http://tkhtml.tcl.tk/support.html. 
* Most CSS pseudo-elements, such as `:hover` and `:active` are also supported. 
* On 64-bit Windows and Linux, ``border-radius`` and more cursor options are also supported. ``overflow-x`` is also supported on ``body`` and ``html`` elements.

**JavaScript:**
* Javascript only partly supported at the moment.
   * To use JavaScript, PythonMonkey must be installed.
* See [Using JavaScript](https://tkinterweb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/javascript.html) for more information and [DOM Manipulation with TkinterWeb](https://tkinterweb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dom.html) for information on manipulating the document through Python.

**Images:**
* TkinterWeb supports nearly 50 different image types through PIL.
    * In order to load Scalable Vector Graphic images, CairoSVG, both PyCairo and PyGObject, or both PyCairo and Rsvg must be installed. 
* Without these packages, TkinterWeb will still function properly, but SVG files will not be shown.
